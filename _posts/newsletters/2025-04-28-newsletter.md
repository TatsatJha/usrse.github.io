**Call for Submissions**

We invite submissions for [USRSE'25](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/participate/), the third annual conference from the United States Research Software Engineer Association ([US-RSE](https://us-rse.org/)), to be held in 🦅 **Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 🦅 October 6-8, 2025**. 

Do you write code for your research? Are you curious about career paths available to computational researchers? If so, USRSE’25 is the perfect venue to showcase your work\!

Whether you’re a data scientist, digital humanist, scientific programmer, software developer, or research software user, US-RSE is where people at the intersection of code and research come together. The USRSE'25 conference is your chance to connect with peers, mentors, and experts in the fast-growing world of research software. Don’t just take our word for it—100% of last year's post-conference survey respondents said they would return and recommend the conference to others.

This year’s conference theme is **“Code, Practices, and People.”** Submission formats include Birds of a Feather (BoFs), workshops, short talks (including papers, talk abstracts, and notebooks), and posters. **The submission deadline for all formats (except posters) is May 16, 2025\.** Poster submissions are due July 20, 2025\. 

Visit the [conference website](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/participate/) for further details including:

- Technical topics of interest aligned with the conference theme (see last year’s [program](https://us-rse.org/usrse24/program/) for ideas)  
- Submission formats, templates, and associated deadlines   
- ***New Journal Opportunity***: authors whose papers are accepted to USRSE’25 will be invited to submit to a [special issue](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/participate/special-issue/) of the journal Future Generation Computer Systems. Check our [previous special issues](https://www.sciencedirect.com/special-issue/10GXQ2MQKBW).
- How and where to submit  
- Dates for notification of acceptance and other important dates  
- Venue, hotel, and travel [details](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/attend/)

> April is Volunteer Appreciation Month, and we want to take a moment to send a huge **THANK YOU** to all of you who give your time, energy, and heart to this community 💜 Your contributions — whether it’s organizing events, leading and participating in working groups, working on the job board, sharing ideas, mentoring, advocating, or simply showing up — are what make this space vibrant, welcoming, and impactful. We couldn’t do it without you.
On behalf of the Executive Director and the Steering Committee: **we see you, we appreciate you, and we’re so grateful for everything you do.**
Here’s to you — our amazing volunteers! 🎉 👏 ⭐️

# 🛞 **3. Steering Committee Updates**

<!--Steering committee updates-->
In March, the Steering Committee looked at financing for the US-RSE'25 conference, particularly in light of the current funding climate and the balance between organizational memberships and conference sponsorships, and tentatively approved the conference attendance fees. We followed up on the action items from our strategic planning meeting in February, assigning subcommittees for the areas of focus we identified there. We discussed the potential impacts of hiring a new part-time community manager; expect to hear more on this soon. Finally, we assisted our Executive Director in applying for (and being granted) a no-cost extension to our Sloan funding and also worked with her to debrief the first Organizational Member meeting that took place in late February.

# 🤝 **5. Organizational Founding Membership**  

US-RSE envisions a future where Research Software Engineers are universally respected for advancing science, technology, and society through the transformative power of research software engineering.
We’re excited to share that the momentum around our Organizational Founding Membership continues to grow! See the list below for the current members (six more are onboarding at the moment).

Organizations that join on or before November 30, 2025, will be recognized in perpetuity as founding members. Founding organizations will also lock in current membership fees through December 31, 2028.
Organizational support helps sustain and expand vital community offerings, including the annual conference, monthly calls and newsletter, job board, working groups, and new resources.

  <p>
    They came as a herd, packed together in a carton, just like how research software engineers come together to build a stronger community. But now, these unicorns are ready to set off on their own journeys—finding new homes with RSEs, allies, and supporters like you.
  </p>

  <p>
    This year’s edition proudly wears a red shirt featuring the US-RSE logo integrated with 2025, symbolizing another year of growth, collaboration, and impact. Just like our community, these unicorns remind us that while we each have our own paths, we are part of something bigger—a movement dedicated to advancing research software and supporting those who make it happen.
  </p>

  <p>
    By adopting a unicorn, you’re not just getting a fun desk companion—you’re also supporting US-RSE’s mission to strengthen the RSE community, advocate for recognition, and create more opportunities for collaboration.
  </p>

  <p>
    📦 Limited supply—once they leave the herd, they’re gone!
  </p>

  <p>
    🚚 They’ll ship for free within the US! 🚚
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're from another country and want to get your hands on a unicorn, reach out to us, and we'll find out whether we can arrange shipping for you.
  </p>

  <p>
    Don't miss out on this opportunity to own a piece of US-RSE magic and donate to get your Unicorn 2025 Edition today. This edition will be available while supplies last until December 10, 2025 ✨🦄✨

# 🏃 **8. Get Involved**

Volunteering with US-RSE is a great way to build your professional network and gain skills that can help you take the next step in your career.  A great way to start is by joining a working group.  Reach out to contact@us-rse.org or ask on Slack if you have questions about getting started.  

New guidance was recently released on how to create new [Affinity Groups](https://us-rse.org/wg/group-management/form-an-affinity-group) and [Working Groups](https://us-rse.org/wg/group-management/form-a-working-group). If you see an unmet need in the US-RSE community, we encourage you to create your own group!

As always, we thank everyone who is already contributing for their help in shaping and growing the organization.

[US-RSE Working Groups](https://us-rse.org/working-groups/):

{% assign wgs = site.data.menus.working-groups.items %}

<ul>
