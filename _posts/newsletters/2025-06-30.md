Welcome to this month‚Äôs edition of the US-RSE Newsletter! A few weeks ago, I found myself wondering: Who visits the US-RSE website? What are they looking for? How are they finding us? To satisfy that curiosity, I took a dive into our Google Analytics data, and uncovered some interesting patterns. In this issue, we‚Äôll explore a few highlights from our website traffic that offer a glimpse into how our community is connecting with US-RSE online, and consider what these insights might mean for the future of our digital presence.

* [1. USRSE'25 Conference](#conference2025)

# üîç **2. A Peek at the US-RSE Website ‚Äî What Brings You Here?**

<!-- Add monthly theme / highlight -->

Web analytics is a fascinating and exciting application
of data science involving the measurement, collection,
analysis, and reporting of web data to understand and
optimize website usage. Using a few simple techniques and powerful tools like Google Analytics 4, organizations like ours can learn incredible insights about who visits our website, what they do with it, and why. So, what does the US-RSE.org website data tell us about ourselves?

# ü§ù **4. Organizational Founding Membership**

US-RSE envisions a future where Research Software Engineers are universally respected for advancing science, technology, and society through the transformative power of research software engineering.
We‚Äôre excited to share that the momentum around our Organizational Founding Membership continues to grow! See the list below for the current members (six more are onboarding at the moment).

Organizations that join on or before November 30, 2025, will be recognized in perpetuity as founding members. Founding organizations will also lock in current membership fees through December 31, 2028.
Organizational support helps sustain and expand vital community offerings, including the annual conference, monthly calls and newsletter, job board, working groups, and new resources.

### **Community Calls**

<!--Community call news goes here-->

During our last community call, we got some great suggestions for future topics, including lots of interest in learning about the US-RSE community, careers, and funding. Our July community call on Thursday, July 10, 12pm ET/11am CT/10am MT/9am PT will cover all of these topics (and maybe more!). 

If you'd like to give a brief 3-5 minute talk on your story, we'd be happy to hear from you. This could be talking about what your current role is and what you're working on, how you're funded, or the path you took to get where you are today. Even if you're not an RSE, you're here, so you're part of our community, and we'd love to hear what you do and how your work relates to RSE.

Please reach out to Julia Damerow or Abbey Roelofs via Slack if you're interested in presenting, and visit the [Community Calls Website](https://us-rse.org/events/category/#community-call) for more information and to access the registration link.
