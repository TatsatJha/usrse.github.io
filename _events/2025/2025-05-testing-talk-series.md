The Testing working group is happy to introduce a new Talk Series on Software Testing on Wednesday May 21, 2-3 PM EDT. 
Title: **"Software Testing for Fisheries Integrated Modeling System: strategies, challenges, and opportunities."** Presenter: **Bai Li**

### Abstract

While creating perfect software may not be possible, it is essential
to test software before its release to reduce the risk of mistakes
that negatively impact users. High-quality software testing is crucial
for ensuring the reliability, reproducibility, and long-term usability
of research software. This presentation highlights the testing
framework designed for the Fisheries Integrated Modeling System
(FIMS), which is a next-generation framework for assessing the status
of living marine resources and providing management advice. I will
provide an overview of the testing strategies currently implemented in
FIMS, including unit testing and integration testing in C++ and R, as
well as testing using case studies. I will also present testing
schedules and continuous integration tools that support both
development and project management workflows, along with a demo of
practices relevant to the testing of research software. The
presentation will address challenges we have encountered and are
currently facing, such as balancing rapid prototyping with rigorous
testing, prioritizing test activities to meet project goals without
exhaustive testing, and setting meaningful acceptance criteria,
including tolerance levels for testing statistical software. Finally,
I will discuss potential opportunities to strengthen the testing
culture and improve testing suites. I welcome feedback on building
more robust and maintainable research software.

### Biography

Bai Li is a contractor with ECS Federal LLC, supporting the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries Office of
Science and Technology. She is currently involved in the development
of the Fisheries Integrated Modeling System, with a focus on testing
and the R-based user interface. She also leads a research project
aimed at incorporating interdisciplinary data into traditional
fisheries stock assessments. Bai Li holds a B.S. in Marine Resources
from Shanghai Ocean University, a B.S. in Marine Biology from the
University of Maine, and a Ph.D. in Marine Biology from the University
of Maine. She joined NOAAâ€™s National Stock Assessment Program within
the Office of Science and Technology in 2019 as a National Research
Council Research Associate. In 2020, she transitioned to her current
role as a stock assessment modeling contractor. She lives in Northern
Virginia and enjoys hiking and camping in her free time.
