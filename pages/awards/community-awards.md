supported Community Awards for US-RSE members and the RSE community. The goals of this award program are to:

- Recognize individuals who have made noteworthy contributions to RSE community.

- Connect people within the US-RSE community.
- Assist individuals to grow in their own career.

### Call for 2025 US-RSE Community Awards Nominations

The US Research Software Engineer Association (US-RSE) is excited to announce
that nominations are now open for the 2025 US-RSE Community Awards! These
awards recognize and celebrate the impactful contributions of individuals and
teams who are advancing the field of research software engineering in the
United States.

Each award will be presented in two categories:

- **Student/Early Career** (current student or within five years of starting their career)
- **Professional**

Winners will receive an award certificate, recognition on the US-RSE website,
a $250 gift card, and recognition at the [2025 US-RSE Annual Conference (USRSE'25)](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/).
If a team is selected, the gift card will be awarded to the group as a whole
rather than to individual members.
We invite you to nominate yourself or a colleague for one of the following awards.

#### US‑RSE Technical Excellence Award

This award recognizes outstanding technical contributions that materially advance
research software engineering practice. This award celebrates "the things RSEs
do that are normally ignored," such as but not limited to:

- **Reproducibility and Re‑use**: Delivering artifacts, tools, or workflows that
  others can pick up and run with minimal friction, whether open‑source or shared
  under appropriate proprietary constraints.
- **Modernization and Sustainability**: Porting legacy codes to new architectures,
  improving performance, documentation, testing, or CI so software retains long-term viability.
- **Mentorship in Craft**: Sharing technical know-how through code review, pair
  programming, tutorials, or design docs – that raises knowledge and/or quality
  for a team or community.

#### US‑RSE Community Impact and Leadership Award

Purpose: Honors leadership and service that amplifies the reach, visibility,
and growth of the RSE profession. This award focuses on people who step beyond
their own codebases to promote belonging, engagement, and awareness, such as
but not limited to:

- **Strategic Leadership**: Leading initiatives (working groups, committees,
  workshops, training sessions, etc.) that advance RSE knowledge and careers,
  either regionally or nationwide.
- **Mentorship and Talent Development**: Guiding students, early-career RSEs,
  or domain scientists to build skills and confidence in research software.
- **Outreach and Advocacy**: Promoting better practices and spreading the
  "voice of the RSE" through workshops, publications (in journals/conferences
  or "grey" material, e.g., blog posts), policy input, or cross‑institution collaboration.

### Eligibility
