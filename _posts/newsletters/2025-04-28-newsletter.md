# **1. US-RSE Conference 2025 (USRSE'25)**  

**Call for Submissions**

We invite submissions for [USRSE'25](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/participate/), the third annual conference from the United States Research Software Engineer Association ([US-RSE](https://us-rse.org/)), to be held in **Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, October 6-8, 2025**. 

Do you write code for your research? Are you curious about career paths available to computational researchers? If so, USRSE‚Äô25 is the perfect venue to showcase your work\!

Whether you‚Äôre a data scientist, digital humanist, scientific programmer, software developer, or research software user, US-RSE is where people at the intersection of code and research come together. The USRSE'25 conference is your chance to connect with peers, mentors, and experts in the fast-growing world of research software. Don‚Äôt just take our word for it‚Äî100% of last year's post-conference survey respondents said they would return and recommend the conference to others.

This year‚Äôs conference theme is ‚ÄúCode, Practices, and People.‚Äù Submission formats include Birds of a Feather (BoFs), workshops, short talks (including papers, talk abstracts, and notebooks), and posters. **The submission deadline for all formats (except posters) is May 16, 2025\.** Poster submissions are due July 20, 2025\. 

Visit the [conference website](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/participate/) for further details including:

- Technical topics of interest aligned with the conference theme (see last year‚Äôs [program](https://us-rse.org/usrse24/program/) for ideas)

# **2. Shoutout to Our Volunteers**

<!--Save this placeholder for the "headline" of the month-->
April is Volunteer Appreciation Month, and we want to take a moment to send a huge **THANK YOU** to all of you who give your time, energy, and heart to this community :purple_heart:
Your contributions ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs organizing events, leading and participating in working groups, working on the job board, sharing ideas, mentoring, advocating, or simply showing up ‚Äî are what make this space vibrant, welcoming, and impactful. We couldn‚Äôt do it without you.
On behalf of the Executive Director and the Steering Committee: **we see you, we appreciate you, and we‚Äôre so grateful for everything you do.**
Here‚Äôs to you ‚Äî our amazing volunteers! :tada::clap::star2:

# **3. Steering Committee Updates**  

<!--Steering committee updates-->
In March, the Steering Committee looked at financing for the US-RSE'25 conference, particularly in light of the current funding climate and the balance between organizational memberships and conference sponsorships, and tentatively approved the conference attendance fees. We followed up on the action items from our strategic planning meeting in February, assigning subcommittees for the areas of focus we identified there. We discussed the potential impacts of hiring a new part-time community manager; expect to hear more on this soon. Finally, we assisted our Executive Director in applying for (and being granted) a no-cost extension to our Sloan funding and also worked with her to debrief the first Organizational Member meeting that took place in late February.

# **5. Organizational Founding Membership**  

US-RSE envisions a future where Research Software Engineers are universally respected for advancing science, technology, and society through the transformative power of research software engineering.
We‚Äôre excited to share that the momentum around our Organizational Founding Membership continues to grow! See the list below for the current members (six more are onboarding at the moment).

Organizations that join on or before November 30, 2025, will be recognized in perpetuity as founding members. Founding organizations will also lock in current membership fees through December 31, 2028.
Organizational support helps sustain and expand vital community offerings, including the annual conference, monthly calls and newsletter, job board, working groups, and new resources.

Please reach out to Sandra Gesing at sandra@us-rse.org if you are interested in becoming an organizational founding member!

# **8. Get Involved**

Volunteering with US-RSE is a great way to build your professional network and gain skills that can help you take the next step in your career.  A great way to start is by joining a working group.  Reach out to contact@us-rse.org or ask on Slack if you have questions about getting started.  

New guidance was recently released on how to create new [Affinity Groups](https://us-rse.org/wg/group-management/form-an-affinity-group) and [Working Groups](https://us-rse.org/wg/group-management/form-a-working-group). If you see an unmet need in the US-RSE community, we encourage you to create your own group!

As always, we thank everyone who is already contributing for their help in shaping and growing the organization.
