Our **June Community Call** will be all about **AI in Research Software Engineering** on Friday, June 13, at 2pm ET/1pm CT/12pm MT/11am PT.

It's been almost two years since we talked about AI, ChatGPT, and LLMs in RSEng, and a lot has changed in that time! Let's get together and share how we're using these tools today to write code, check code, or otherwise help out in our roles as RSEs. What do they mean for our job? How are they best deployed? Do they create trustworthy code? Or maybe you use them for research rather than for creating code for research? What do they mean for the next generation of research software engineers? These and so many more questions will be discussed at our next community call. Join us and share your experiences and opinions!
