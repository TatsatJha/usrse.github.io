Our **May Community Call** will be all about **USRSE’25! Share your favorite conference experiences** on Thursday, May 8, 12pm ET/11am CT/10am MT/9am PT.

**[USRSE’25](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/) is being held in Philadelphia, October 6-8 this year!** That’s only 5 months away, and the submission deadline for most session types is even closer, on May 16. So in this month’s community call we want to talk about conference experiences! What’s your favorite thing to do at a conference? Which topics do you look forward to the most? Is there something the USRSE’25 conference organizers could do or provide to make your attendance even better? Would you like to get feedback on a submission idea or find some collaborators for a potential submission? Come join us at this month's community call to **hear from this year's conference planners** about what to look forward to and talk about all this and more!
