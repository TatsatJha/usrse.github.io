# Overview

DMV (Delaware-Maryland-Virginia) RSE is a regional affinity group for professionals in RSE and RSE-adjacent disciplines. We organize informal gatherings where interested professionals can connect and learn from each other.

# Membership

DMV-RSE is open to anyone who considers themselves a research software engineer or ally and lives in the DMV area, regardless of job title or domain. This includes workers in academic research (students, postdocs, and professors), as well as RSE professionals in government, industry and other sectors (e.g. non-profit orgs).

# Activities

We organize in-person meetups approximately every 2-3 months. These are currently hosted at Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology in Washington DC. Each meetup consists of an invited talk by a guest speaker on a focused RSE topic with time for networking before and after. The event is followed by a dinner/happy hour at a nearby restaurant.
